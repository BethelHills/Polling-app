-- Create Comprehensive Owner Policy for Polls
-- This policy gives poll owners full access to their polls

-- ==============================================
-- 1. DROP EXISTING POLICY (if it exists)
-- ==============================================

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "polls_owner_full_access" ON polls;

-- ==============================================
-- 2. CREATE COMPREHENSIVE OWNER POLICY
-- ==============================================

-- This policy allows poll owners to perform ALL operations on their polls
-- It covers SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations

-- ==============================================
-- 3. VERIFY POLICY CREATION
-- ==============================================

-- 5. POLICY COMPARISON
-- ==============================================

-- 6. SECURITY NOTES
-- ==============================================

/*
COMPREHENSIVE OWNER POLICY BENEFITS:

✅ SIMPLIFIED ACCESS CONTROL
   - Single policy covers all operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Reduces policy complexity and maintenance overhead
   - Clear ownership model

✅ ENHANCED SECURITY
   - Poll owners have complete control over their data
   - Prevents unauthorized access to other users' polls
   - Maintains data isolation between users

✅ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
   - Single policy evaluation instead of multiple policies
   - Efficient owner_id = auth.uid() condition
   - Works well with database indexes

✅ FLEXIBILITY
   - Owners can perform any operation on their polls
   - Supports complex poll management workflows
   - Easy to extend for additional owner privileges

USAGE SCENARIOS:
- Poll owners can view, edit, delete their polls
- Poll owners can manage poll settings and options
- Poll owners can control poll visibility and status
- Poll owners can export poll data and results

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Ensure auth.uid() is properly set in your application
- Test with different user contexts
- Monitor for any policy conflicts
- Consider adding audit logging for owner actions
