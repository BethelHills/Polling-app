-- 5. TEST SECURITY VIOLATIONS
-- ==============================================

-- These should fail and demonstrate RLS is working:

-- This should fail if RLS is working

VALUES ('Unauthorized Poll', 'Should fail', 'fake-user-id', true);

-- Test 2: Try to vote without authentication
-- This should fail if RLS is working
INSERT INTO votes (poll_id, option_id, user_id)
VALUES ('fake-poll-id', 'fake-option-id', 'fake-user-id');

-- Test 3: Try to update someone else's poll
-- This should fail if RLS is working
UPDATE polls 
SET title = 'Hacked Title'
WHERE owner_id != auth.uid();
*/

-- ==============================================
-- 6. PERFORMANCE CHECK
-- ==============================================

-- Check if indexes are being used with RLS
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT p.id, p.title, COUNT(po.id) as option_count
